# RockbusterStealth
## Project Overview 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that had physical stores worldwide.  In order to remain competitive with services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, it is using its existing movie licenses to set up an online video streaming platform.  The goal of this project was to analyze Rockbuster data and answer key questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.  Insights drawn from the analysis can then be used for their launch strategy.  
## Key Questions 
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## Data Set 
The data contains information about film inventory, customers, and payments.  
## Tools Used
The Rockbuster data set was loaded into PostgreSQL, where it was then queried.  PostgreSQL was managed by pgAdmin4.  Tableau was used to create visualizations from query outputs.
